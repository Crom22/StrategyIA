# StrategyIA
This is the GUI branch. All it does is add a nice GUI to the Framework. You will still need grSim, but the GUI makes it easy to draw debug lines. The GUI also interacts with grSim allowing you to move the ball and the robots using your mouse.

# Usage
Keys 1 to 6: Select robots on the yellow team.

Keys Q, W, E, R, T, Y: Select robots on the blue team.

The D key toggles the debug mode. When the debug mode is off, you can't move the robots or the ball.


Left click moves the ball.

Right click moves the selected robot.

Middle click changes the orientation of the selected robot. (The robot will be looking towards the mouse.)
